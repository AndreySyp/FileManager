# FileManager
Convenient organizer for working with files

My first attempt at creating a GUI application utilizing C#, WPF.
Via this program you can create lists of various files or folders. So then you have the opportunity to work with them very conveniently: you can open, delete, change position on the disk, sort files and lists, and also search for the required files in all lists
