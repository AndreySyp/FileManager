# FileManager
Convenient organizer for working with files

My first attempt at creating a GUI application using C#, WPF
In this program, you can create lists to which you can add various files or folders. After that, you have the opportunity to work with them very conveniently: open, delete, change position on the disk, you can sort files and lists, and also search for the necessary files in all lists
